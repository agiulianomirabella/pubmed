Papers searching automation with Python

This project consists of a web scratching app that automates the task of searching in Pubmed for physiotherapy-related scientific papers. I worked on it in order to learn how web scratching works, justo for fun.

Some details need to be taken into account for the app to work:
* The web browser is supposed to be Google Chrome
* It is meant to work on Windows
* The chromedriver is supposed to be located in a folder: `'C:/pubmed_bot/'`
